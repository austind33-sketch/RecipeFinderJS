# Overview

This project is a Recipe Finder application that I designed to assist my growth and understanding as a software engineer. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in JavaScript by creating a functional and interactive application.

The Recipe Finder allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients they have. It fetches data from an external API and displays the results in a user-friendly format. This project showcases the use of modern JavaScript features, including ES6 syntax, recursion, and third-party libraries.

The purpose of writing this software is to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and its ecosystem, including Node.js and npm packages. It also aims to improve my ability to write clean, maintainable code and document it effectively.
